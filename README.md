To-Do List Application

Project Overview

This is a simple To-Do List Application that I created to practice my web development skills. The application allows users to add, manage, and delete tasks .  

Features

Add Tasks: Users can input a task and click the "Submit" button to add it to the list.

Delete Tasks: Each task has an "X" button for easy deletion.

How It Works
Input Task: Enter a task in the input field provided at the top.

Submit Task: Click the "Submit" button to add the task to the list.

Delete Task: Each task has an "X" button at the right. Clicking it will remove the task from the list.

Files and Structure

index.html: The main file containing the structure of the To-Do List.

styles.css: The CSS file for styling the app, making it visually appealing.

script.js: The JavaScript file that handles adding and deleting tasks.
